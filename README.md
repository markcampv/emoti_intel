# emoti_intel

Emoti_intel is a journal used through the command line. Any response is saved in SQL along with the time the journal was written. The program will prompt you to write or read a journal entry. You then have the option to choose between the following emotions:

* happy
* sad
* excited
* anger
* dissapointment

After typing one of these options, you can then make a journal entry, which will then be saved in your SQL db.
